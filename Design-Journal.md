####INGE DRUCKREY

>**“You can't come up with ideas if you don't see first.” – Inge Druckrey**

During today’s class we were given the pleasure of watching an inspirational video by **Inge Druckrey** called ['Teaching to See'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldSkPqZKBl0). In the 1960’s – 70’s the German designer and educator was one of the first to initialize **Swiss School of design** to the United States.

**Beethoven – Yale Symphony Orchestra** was one of Inge Druckrey’s posters that caught my eye. The Poster was created in **1979**; she used the contrast of light and dark, to relate to the life of Beethoven, as he suffered from depression but then transitioned to very active working periods. It initiated with the Large B, within the B is one of Beethoven’s manuscripts. I like how she has subtly put in the staff-lines, and other lines throughout, as it connects well with the whole poster. Beethoven is spelt throughout the poster, such as the Large E that is set in the Negative area. I like how has made this poster so simplistic but it puzzles the viewers to try figure it out.

####CIRCLES

With just a pen, circle stencil and paper we were given the task of drawing one circle twenty times, changing its scale and position within the square. By just changing the size and placement we created some interesting, yet simplistic arrangements. We continued on from one and worked our way up to doing two, three and five. With more circles to work with our patterns became more detailed and fascinating. We then moved up to fifty circles, but this had to be done on computer as it would be too time consuming and laborious to do on paper.

* Pic - 20 - 1 circle
* Pic – 20 - 2 circles
* Pic – 20 - 3 circles
* Pic – 20 - 5 Circles
* Pic – 20 - 50 circles

After doing the circle studies, we were given the task to create wallpapers for Iphones. I created these wallpapers using Adobe Illustrator.
