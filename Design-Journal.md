* Cave Painting and Illuminated Manuscripts

During this week’s lecture a vast amount of content was covered. When I walked out of the lecture I felt as if my brain was overflowing with new knowledge about these topics. The subjects of the lecture this week was about the historical Cave Paintings of our prehistoric selves, the golden ratio, illuminated manuscripts, and how modern day artists were inspired by previous artists work. I had very little understanding and knowledge about most of these topics so it was all new to me. 

ALBUM COVERS
This morning’s lecture initiated by looking at album covers that had been influenced by old artwork. One of them was the Chemical Brothers album ‘We Are the Night’ which was released in 2007; it’s album artwork was very similar to the piece Lonely Politician by the artist named Herbert Bayer in 1932.
